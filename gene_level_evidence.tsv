STAG2	STAG2 mutant	myelodysplastic syndrome	not applicable	N/A	Guideline	Prognostic	STAG2 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (NCCN.org).	detail...
STK11	STK11 inact mut	Advanced Solid Tumor	sensitive	Trametinib	Preclinical - Cell culture	Actionable	In a preclinical study, the presence of an STK11 loss expression signature, which correlated to STK11 inactivating mutations, was associated with increased sensitivity to Mekinist (trametinib) in human tumor cell lines in culture (PMID: 27821489).	27821489
